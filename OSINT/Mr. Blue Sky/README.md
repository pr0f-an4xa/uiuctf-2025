### Challenge
Mr. Blue Sky is your average go-lucky BlueSky user, but is there something more to his profile? See if you can find anything on his profile (https://bsky.app/profile/mrbluesky1989.bsky.social)

This is the introduction to an OSINT suite. While all other OSINT challenges can be performed in any order, I recommend starting here.

The link directs to https://bsky.app/profile/mrbluesky1989.bsky.social. When I checked the profile, there is only one post.
